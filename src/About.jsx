          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            We aim to break down barriers and share the joy of tennis with youth from all backgrounds.
            Our mission is to create inclusive, fun, and supportive spaces where kids can grow both on and off the court.
          </p>
          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a future where every child‚Äîregardless of income, location, or experience‚Äîhas the opportunity
            to learn, grow, and thrive through tennis. We hope to expand our reach nationally and develop future leaders
            who give back to their communities through sport.
